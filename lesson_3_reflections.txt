git remote #kind of like creating a branch
remote #a repository on github, you push and pull
git remote # lists the remote repositories
git remote -v#verbose
	shows url where you would fetch and push data 
get push <remote> <local> sends local stuff to repository
git config --global credential.helper wincred  #password cache

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-working from multiple sites, working with multiple contributors, data backup
